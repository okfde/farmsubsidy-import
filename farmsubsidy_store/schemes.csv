It consists of two main elements: the specific supply arrangements and the measures to support local production. The former aims at mitigating additional costs for supplying essential products resulting from the remoteness of these regions (through aid for products from the EU and exemption from import duties for products from third countries) and the latter at assisting the development of the local agriculture sector (direct payments and market measures). POSEI also allows the financing of plant-health programmes."
